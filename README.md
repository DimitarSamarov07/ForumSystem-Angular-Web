# ForumSystem-Angular-Web
My own project *[ForumSystem](https://github.com/DimitarSamarov07/ForumSystem-Web)* rewritten in Angular. That's my
project assignment for the Angular course in SoftUni.

## :pencil: Project Description
This is a quick rewrite of my old project. It took me 2 weeks to rewrite the project in Angular to a big
extent. The project is divided into 2 areas - an Admin area, and a global one. There are 2 interceptors - one is responsible for parsing all HTTP requests
to HTTPS ones, and the other one is caching some requests.
Feel free to use my project for whatever you'd like. Cheers :)

## How to run the project locally
Running the project is very simple. Open a new terminal, copy the commands below, and you should be good to go.
```
git clone "https://github.com/DimitarSamarov07/ForumSystem-Angular-Web"
```

```
cd ForumSystem-Angular-Web
```

```
npm i
```

```
ng serve
```

Enjoy :)
